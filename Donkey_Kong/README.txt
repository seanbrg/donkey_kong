For our submission of exercise 2 we decided to take some creative liberties to make the game more fun and faithful to the original, in several ways:
1. Our score system mimics the score system in the original game. Score is obtained by finishing a stage fast enough, by jumping over barrels and ghost or by destroying them with a hammer.
2. The hammer can be visibly seen as "carried" by the Mario character, and its hit range is 2 spaces instead of 1 (a feature recommended by Kirsh in one of the classes). We chose to depict a hit with a hammer using an animation that replaces it with different characters that resemble a hitting hammer.

In addition, not only does our code implement important OOP principles such as inheritance and polymorphism, it also covers many edge cases when it comes to handling user-made files. Our code can handle smaller or larger files than expected by redrawing the 'Q' frame and it can convert unfitting characters into spaces. Any case of invalid file is treated with an appropriate error message. We also made sure that the menu allows loading several files in the order of their input.
